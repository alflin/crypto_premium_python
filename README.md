# crypto_premium_python_script

Pulling crypto premiums from okex using python.
This script will be a baseline for building some data viz later on...most likely will build it in flask.

Also thinking of doing the same thing in R, just to test out the R + shiny performance.


# crypto_premium_shiny_frontend

Biggest pain in the world [link](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/194).
I spent all day trying to figure out why my reticulate package wasn't working.....then I realized I can't use python3!!!!!


I just quickly created a python 2.7 virtualenv from this [link](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
and got it all working
